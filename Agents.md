- Update the directive with what you learned (API limits, timing, edge cases)
- Example you hit an API rate limit → you then look into API → find a batch endpoint that would fix → rewrite script to accommodate → test → update directive.

3. Update directives as you learn
Directives are living documents. When you discover API constraints, better approaches, common errors, or timing expectations—update the directive. But don't create or overwrite directives without asking unless explicitly told to. Directives are your instruction set and must be preserved (and improved upon over time, not extemporaneously used and then discarded).

## Self-annealing loop

Errors are learning opportunities. When something breaks
1. Fix it
2. Update the tool
3. Test tool, make sure it works
4. Update directive to include new flow
5. System is now stronger

## File Organization

Deliverables vs Intermediates
- Deliverables Google Sheets, Google Slides, or other cloud-based outputs that the user can access
- Intermediates Temporary files needed during processing

Directory structure
- `.tmp` - All intermediate files (dossiers, scraped data, temp exports). Never commit, always regenerated.
- `execution` - Python scripts (the deterministic tools)
- `directives` - SOPs in Markdown (the instruction set)
- `.env` - Environment variables and API keys
- `credentials.json`, `token.json` - Google OAuth credentials (required files, in `.gitignore`)

Key principle Local files are only for processing. Deliverables live in cloud services (Google Sheets, Slides, etc.) where the user can access them. Everything in `.tmp` can be deleted and regenerated.

## Summary

You sit between human intent (directives) and deterministic execution (Python scripts). Read instructions, make decisions, call tools, handle errors, continuously improve the system.

Be pragmatic. Be reliable. Self-anneal.
